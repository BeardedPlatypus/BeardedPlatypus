Hi there, and thanks for checking out my github profile! I am a software
engineer from the netherlands with a passion for Computer Graphics, functional
programming and intuitive desktop applications.  

## Professional life: .NET developer at Deltares

I am currently employed at Deltares, a water knowledge institute, where I work
as a .NET software engineer and scrum master. In my day-to-day work, I 
improve our Hydrodynamic modeling suites as well as our automated processes
using a big dose of C# and a sparkle of python.

## Down time: More programming, but with colours

When I am not programming professionally, I can usually be found programming 
unprofessionally, ehr, programming on my personal projects! Mostly this 
consists of over-engineering simple graphics applications. I am still trying to
break into game-development, some day ...  
Most of my personal projects can be found right here on github. Currently I am
a bit obsessed with F# and Fabulous for Xamarin.Forms. Other than that I can 
often be found programming in C++, with an occassional outing into Elm, python
or other programming language.

Besides programming I try to continuously learn new things. Sometimes draw, mostly
poorly, and occassionally work on custom keyboard designs.
